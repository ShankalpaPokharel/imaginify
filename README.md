This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Express Monoose Next.js

Express
Persistent Server: Express applications typically run on a persistent server where the process remains active for a long duration. This allows for maintaining a single database connection throughout the server's lifetime.
Initial Connection: Connection to the database is usually established once when the server starts and is reused for all incoming requests.
Resource Management: The server's lifecycle is managed manually, allowing for more controlled resource usage and connection handling.
Next.js
Serverless Functions: API routes in Next.js are often serverless, leading to the need for connection handling on each request due to ephemeral instances.
Cached Connections: To optimize performance, a cached connection approach is used to reuse connections when possible without exhausting resources.
Automatic Scaling: Serverless environments automatically scale up and down, requiring a more dynamic approach to connection manageme
